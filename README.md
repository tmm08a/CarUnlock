<h1>CarUnlock</h1>
=========

This code (Along with the servo motors and arm) will unlock a car door which uses a 0-9 number pad.
It goes through every possible combination without repeating. There are 3130 numbers to be typed in in the correct order.
More in code comments

There was an attempt to detect when the door unlocked so it could save the number, but I could not get the sensor 
to detect when it unlocked, as you cannot always see the lock. If anyone has any ideas I'd appreciate it :)
