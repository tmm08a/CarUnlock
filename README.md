<h1>CarUnlock</h1>
=========

This code (Along with the servo motors and arm) will unlock a car door which uses a 0-9 number pad.
It goes through every possible combination (without repeating). 

There was an attempt to detect when the door unlocked so it could save the number, but I could not get the sensor 
to detect when it unlocked, as you cannot always see the lock. If anyone has any ideas I'd appreciate it :)

For a better understanding, read the code comments. Much better explanation there of how this all works!
